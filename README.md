# CVEplus
CVE+ is a pyhton script that utilises searchsploit and public repositories to help users find the right CVE.
<br>
It makes a search for whatever service the user enters. It searches using searchsploits exploit database and returns results as JSON. 
From here it checks the results to find if any have CVE's associated with them.
You can mirror the wanted CVE from here or you can continue to find out more information from them.
If you chose to learn more it checks https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelist
<br>
from here it finds additional information from the repo about the chosen CVE. This includes references, assigners, state etc.
